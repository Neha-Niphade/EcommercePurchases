# Ecommerce Purchases Data Analysis
 Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an E-commerce purchases dataset using Python and Pandas. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing behavior and extract meaningful insights from the data.

#  Objectives

Analyze customer purchase patterns

Identify trends based on job, location, and language

Calculate key metrics such as average purchase price

Explore relationships between different customer attributes
# Project Background

In this project, I explored a fictional e-commerce dataset representing purchase transactions made through Amazon. Although the data is simulated, it helped me practice real-world data analysis techniques.

By solving progressively challenging tasks, I analyzed customer behavior, purchase patterns, and key metrics using Python and Pandas. This project strengthened my skills in data manipulation, filtering, and extracting meaningful insights from raw data.

#  Learning Outcomes

Improved data manipulation skills using Pandas

Gained hands-on experience in filtering, grouping, and aggregating data

Practiced real-world data analysis workflow
